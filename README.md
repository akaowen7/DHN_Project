This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# What is this

This is a project I made for my Digital Arts and the Humanities class. Given a very breif outline I put this together. Its made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (which works on top of [React](https://reactjs.org/)) and with some other addons like [Framer](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

Basicaly this was all way more then I should have tried to do for this one project.

Please ignore when I started this project
